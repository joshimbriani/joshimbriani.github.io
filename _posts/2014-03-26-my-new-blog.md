Welcome to my blog!

I've been meaning to set this thing up for a while and finally got around to it! I'm planning on using this blog to showcase my work and document my journey in programming as well as just sjaring my thoughts about various topics that are important to me. I'd like to update this about once a week but I know that that's probably unreasonable. I will try my best though!

So first a little introduction about myself.

My name is Joshua Imbriani. I'm a freshman at the University of Oklahoma studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about programming and sports. My languages of choice include Python and Javascript. My teams are the Tampa Bay Rays, the Detroit Tigers, the New Orleans Saints, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Columbus Blue Jackets. When I graduate I want to run my own startup. I have a few ideas for businesses, which I will be sure to blog about later!
